         Aviation has transformed our world and has long served humanity by connecting cultures, peoples and families.
         It has powered global trade, pioneered huge advances in technology, and inspired generations with the wonder of
         flight.
        </p>
        <p>
         It supports <strong>over 88 million jobs worldwide</strong>, and continues to drive innovation in technology,
         safety, and efficiency. Yet today, the industry stands at a pivotal moment where we must acknowledge the
         pressing challenges we face.
        </p>
        <div>
         The impact of aviation on our climate is significant, as the industry accounts for approximately 2% of carbon
         emissions, with its global heating impact around
         <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231020305689?via%3Dihub">2-3 times that</a>.

         >. This trajectory raises critical questions about our industry's sustainability and our responsibility to
         align with Earth's delicate systems.

         In this Visioning Assembly we aim to explore and develop alternative pathways that empower the aviation
         industry to thrive, while safeguarding the environment. We believe in a future where millions of job
         opportunities for aviation workers continue to be created and the beauty of flying can be enjoyed for
         generations to come.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are excited to announce our second
         <strong><em>Visioning Assembly: &ldquo;Creating the Future of Aviation.&rdquo;</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         With the UK&rsquo;s rich history as a pioneer of the jet age, we believe it is uniquely positioned to lead the
         charge toward a greener future. Your insights and contributions are essential as we work together to craft an
         inspiring vision of what aviation can become.
        </p>
        <p>
         Join us in London, where expert facilitators from Safe Landing will guide a select group of aviation workers
         and enthusiasts in collaboratively shaping a positive and sustainable future for the industry we all love.
        </p>
        <p>
         The outcomes of these discussions will culminate in a comprehensive report that will be shared with industry
         leaders, policymakers, and the media, ensuring that our collective voice is heard. This report will also be
         accessible on our website for all aviation workers to reference.
        </p>
        <p>
         We hope our approach to collaborative democracy will inspire not only the aviation sector but also other
         high-carbon industries to embrace similar constructive assemblies. Together, we can build a robust platform for
         innovation and cooperation, where diverse voices contribute to shaping the future of our industries.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is just the beginning, and we need your passion and input to soar into a brighter future for aviation.
