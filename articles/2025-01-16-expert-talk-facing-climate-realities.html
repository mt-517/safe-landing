        Caroline is a practicing psychotherapist and member of the&nbsp;<a

         target="_blank"
         rel="noopener"
         >Climate Psychology Alliance</a
        >&nbsp;she has been developing a range of therapeutic approaches to ecological distress including a
        psychological assessment model for eco-anxiety, and delivered workshops in climate psychology, emotional
        resilience, and mental health internationally. Caroline is a lecturer at the University of Bath researching
        children and young people&rsquo;s emotional responses to climate change in the UK, Brazil, The Maldives, Nigeria
        &amp; USA for 10 years&nbsp;examining eco- anxiety &amp; distress, eco-empathy, trauma, moral injury, and the
        impact of climate anxiety on relationships. She is co- lead author on a 2021 quantitative global study into
        10,000 children &amp; young people&rsquo;s emotions &amp; thoughts about climate change published in&nbsp;<a

        It&rsquo;s understood that we all suffer from a form of eco-anxiety but for most of us this is subconscious.
        Given the pressures of our time will undoubtedly be impacting us whilst we work on solving these challenges,
        here&rsquo;s some food for thought from Caroline ahead of the talk:<em><br /></em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>&ldquo;<strong>Apocalyptic disaster or transformational moment in history?</strong></em
        ><br /><em
         >As we become aware of the scale and speed of the threats to the biosphere, our emotional responses mirror our
         increased concern in both intensity and complexity, and we need to navigate binary splits of hope and optimism
         and &lsquo;doom &amp; gloom&rsquo; pessimism. Eco anxiety, grief and despair are all now recognised as
         understandable and rational human responses to the developing crisis. Conversations about climate change will
         bring us face to face with feelings of vulnerability and uncertainty but are also essential if we are to
         develop the emotional resilience that humanity needs to face this uncertain future.&rdquo;</em
        >
       </p>
       <p>
        Caroline gave a 30-minute presentation which was recorded, followed by 30 minutes for Q&amp;A and open
        discussion.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was a unique opportunity to learn from someone who is really at the leading edge of climate aware
        psychology.
