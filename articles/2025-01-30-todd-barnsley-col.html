        Barnsley College invited Todd along to their careers fair as students contemplate which future trajectory their
        education/careers may take.
       </p>
       <p>
        ✈️ Sharing from his own personal experience, Todd offered a new story to the students that it is ok to change
        your mind and set and new flight path in the face adversity.
       </p>
       <p>
        🙋 It was reassuring to learn how many of the students had completed a course of carbon literacy and how some of
        their young leaders were championing climate action.

        🎓 We regularly give talks to groups of college or university students and receive requests from lecturers
        looking to incorporate guest presentations on sustainability into their courses. Or alternatively, as today, we
        receive requests directly from students.
       </p>
       <p>
        💡 We&rsquo;re keen to foster debate and talk to anybody interested in our perspectives and positions &ndash; so
        please get in touch if you&rsquo;d like to arrange this with us in 2025!
