        ✈️ It was a pleasure to give a guest lecture on the challenges and opportunities of &ldquo;Sustainable
        Aviation&rdquo; to aviation management students at the
        <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/">University of Surrey</a> on 6th Feb 2025.
       </p>
       <p>
        🙋🙋&zwj;♂️ There was a great discussion with a room full of ambitious young students motivated to take on these
        challenges in their future careers!
       </p>
       <p>
        🙏 Thanks to Nicole Cocolas, the
        <span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"
         >module leader for Sustainability in Aviation at Surrey University,</span
        >&nbsp;for the invite.
       </p>
       <p>
        🎓 We regularly give talks to groups of college or university students and receive requests from lecturers
        looking to incorporate guest presentations on sustainability into their courses. We sometimes also receive
        requests directly from students.
       </p>
       <p>
        💡 We&rsquo;re keen to foster debate and talk to anybody interested in our perspectives and positions &ndash; so
        please get in touch if you&rsquo;d like to arrange this with us in 2025!
