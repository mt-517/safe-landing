         &ldquo;Airbus has delayed the service-entry target for a hydrogen-powered aircraft developed under its ZEROe

         Blaming significant technological and infrastructure challenges for the move, the airframer nonetheless insists
         it remains &ldquo;committed&rdquo; to the eventual launch of a hydrogen-powered aircraft. However, it provides

         Key changes include service entry delayed by five to 10 years, a 25% reduction in the budget for ZEROe, the
         &ldquo;termination of certain sub-projects&rdquo;, and the axing of a plan to flight-test the fuel cell

       <h5><strong>Future technologies</strong></h5>
       <p>
        From a Safe Landing perspective, this announcement from Airbus is disappointing. Alongside hybrid-electric
        aircraft (which use a combination of battery-electric and jet engines), hydrogen and hydrogen-electric aircraft
        provide the most likely zero-emission alternative to fossil jet fuel-powered aircraft. The likes of Airbus with
        their <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/innovation/energy-transition/hydrogen/zeroe">ZEROe project</a> and
        <a href="https://zeroavia.com/">ZeroAvia</a> have been working on these new technologies.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        So-called sustainable aviation fuel will, at best, only reduce overall emissions down to
        <a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/down-to-earth">2023 levels by 2049 </a>due to limited
        supply and scalability issues. Pure electric aircraft will serve only short-range flights. So, hydrogen and
        hydrogen-electric is a technology we need to be scaling now to provide us with zero emission flight as soon as
        possible. It is difficult to predict the exact configuration of aircraft that will best serve us in the future,
        but it is important to be trialling and testing as many technologies as possible in order for is to understand
        this better.
       </p>
       <h5><strong>Risks and opportunities for aviation workers</strong></h5>
       <p>
        FO have rightfully asked Airbus what the new plan is for future technologies. Aviation workers need to know the
        risks posed to their jobs if future technologies are looking less and less likely to transpire before
        aviation&rsquo;s global carbon budget is used up. Transport &amp; Environment predict the European aviation 1.5
        degree carbon budget to be used up by as early
        <a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/down-to-earth">as 2026</a>. The global carbon budget
        could be completely depleted by<a
         href="https://theicct.org/net-zero-aviation-how-it-started-and-how-its-going-apr24/">
         as early as 2037</a
        >.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        Our industry needs to rapidly innovate to avoid our industry being legislated against as governments scramble to
        meet legally binding emissions reduction targets at the last minute.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <h5><strong>Safe Landing&rsquo;s vision for the future</strong></h5>
       <p>
        At Safe Landing, we want to live in a world where aviation flourishes in harmony with nature, where the beauty
        of flying can be enjoyed by all for generations to come. This means being realistic with future technologies and
        focusing our energy as a sector on innovation. We know first-hand the positive impact flying has brought to
        humanity, connecting cultures, families and communities like never before. We want to continue to enjoy these
        benefits for generations to come whilst staying within nature&rsquo;s boundaries.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of transforming our industry to be fit for the future, we need to put workers in the driving seat of
        change. We want to utilise the expertise workers have, acknowledging that workers have a long-term stake in the
        industry.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <h5><strong>Workers&rsquo; Assemblies</strong></h5>
       <p>
        We <a href="https://safe-landing.org/french-pilots-go-on-strike/">call</a> on unions like FO to start holding
        deliberative, participatory decision-making processes like
        <a href="https://safe-landing.org/assembly/">Workers&rsquo; Assemblies</a> to decide how unions respond to
        industry leaders&rsquo; decarbonisation plans. These assemblies can also be used to produce positions on
        different future technologies and worker-led industrial transformation plans.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to give workers the information and the time they need to decide proactively how our industry
        transforms. We need to trust that workers will make decisions that protect both the industry and the climate.
        Workers&rsquo; Assemblies provide exactly the platform and process for this to happen.
       </p>
       <p><em>If we want to transform our industry, we need to transform our decision-making processes.</em></p>
       <p>
