       <h3>
        George Hibberd and Todd Smith, both former airline pilots and
        <a href="http://safe-landing.org/">Safe Landing</a>community members, attended the
        <a href="https://democracynetwork.org.uk/">Democracy Network</a> Summit at
        <a href="https://www.shu.ac.uk/">Sheffield Hallam University</a> in the UK.
       </h3>
       <p>
        They were amongst many other groups focusing on upgrading our democratic processes and systems.
        <a href="https://www.involve.org.uk/">Involve</a>, who facilitated the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on climate
        change &lsquo;<a href="https://www.climateassembly.uk/">Climate Assembly UK</a>&lsquo; in 2020, hosted the
        summit. involve also facilitated our &ldquo;<a href="https://safe-landing.org/bristol-workshop/"
         >What is the Future of Aviation?&rdquo; workshop</a
        >
        in Bristol in 2023.
       </p>
       <p>
        They took part in networking sessions learning from other groups and sharing our experiences with
        <a href="http://safe-landing.org/assembly">Workers&rsquo; Assemblies</a>. They went to breakout rooms where
        groups shared their work in holding Popular Assemblies in communities to empower people and bring people
        together to decide how to tackle the most important issues of our time.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://safe-landing.org/">Safe Landing</a> shared their expertise in understanding how to empower
        workers in industry to have a voice in how our industries address the climate crisis through processes like
        <a href="http://safe-landing.org/assembly">Workers&rsquo; Assemblies</a>.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        Moving forwards, Safe Landing will be working on our strategy about how to popularise Workers&rsquo; Assemblies
        in trade unions and workplaces and work towards our ultimate goal of having the UK government commission an
        aviation sector-wide Workers&rsquo; Assembly on climate.&nbsp;
