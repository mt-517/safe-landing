       <h2>Luton Airport Expansion Approved</h2>

        ‚úàÔ∏è Today, the UK Transport secretary granted consent to London Luton Airport to effectively

        >.
       </p>
       <p>
        üõ´ The airport plans to expand its perimeter and add a new terminal, allowing a potential 32 million passengers
        a year (up from 16 million in 2024).
       </p>
       <p>
        üë∑&zwj;‚ôÄÔ∏èThe UK Government overruled planning inspectors who recommended blocking the scheme on environmental
        grounds. Government sources said that the promise of thousands of additional jobs had outweighed environmental
        considerations.

        We love flying, and want a sustainable future for our industry that can bring prosperity to the people of
        Britain. We invite Luton Airport to reconsider their current expansion plans and instead commit to building the
        infrastructure needed for zero carbon aircraft.
       </p>
       <p data-mrf-recirculation="LBC Article Links">
        Our industry is at a crossroads. Our current flightpath involves more conventional growth: more flights, bigger
        airports, and rising emissions. We are flying towards environmental limits that will prove extremely difficult
        to navigate. On another route lies a bold transformation toward alternative ways of flying. As Luton is&nbsp;<a

        Electric, hydrogen and hybrid aircraft are our ticket to greener, cleaner and quieter flights. They can reduce
        carbon, air and noise pollution&nbsp;<a

        By opening up a more regional network of smaller airports, they can also improve local access to air travel and
        distribute the benefits to those living across the country.
       </p>
       <p data-mrf-recirculation="LBC Article Links">
        Last month, we visited the hangars of a UK-based start-up developing this technology. There are also plans in
        the pipeline for a first&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecojetair.com/" data-mrf-link="https://www.ecojetair.com/"

        >. However, we face a classic chicken-and-egg scenario: without suitable airport infrastructure we currently
        lack a clear route to market for the first aircraft.

        Luton Airport sits in a prime location to support the UK&rsquo;s ambition to create &lsquo;<a
         href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpzrnxy3zo"
         >Europe&rsquo;s Silicon Valley</a
        >&rsquo; between Oxford and Cambridge. This vision for the region to become the epicentre of technological
        progress could be supported by Luton becoming a hub for zero carbon aircraft.
       </p>
       <p data-mrf-recirculation="LBC Article Links">
        This would provide a clear signal for start-ups and talent to base their companies in the UK. It would also
        supercharge innovation, with spill-over benefits to other areas of the economy.
       </p>
       <p data-mrf-recirculation="LBC Article Links">
        This is how we can back British manufacturing, boost the economy and create jobs &ndash; within environmental
        limits. It just means flying differently: with new types of aircraft and alternative airport designs. There is
        huge potential for employment in designing and developing this technology, operating the aircraft and upgrading
        our airports.
       </p>
       <p data-mrf-recirculation="LBC Article Links">
        We were arguably too slow to capitalise on the transition to electric cars, but Britain&rsquo;s rich aerospace
        heritage puts us in pole position for aviation. We pioneered the last revolution in air travel: the jet age. We
        can now pioneer the future of flight.

        Luton Airport can provide the runway for this to truly take-off.

        The skies are calling for change. Let&rsquo;s seize the opportunity to lead.
