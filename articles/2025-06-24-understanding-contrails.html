    Join Us for this one-of-a-kind conversation between a pilot and ATC…
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Contrails are one of aviation’s biggest contributors to global heating – 
      but they’re also one of the easiest to reduce.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    With the right knowledge and coordination, we could start cutting their impact 
    <b>right now</b> – rapidly lowering aviation’s contribution to warming in the short term.
  </p>
  <p>
    So why isn’t it happening?
  </p>
  <p>
    And what would it take to make that shift – today?
  </p>
  <p>
    Join us for a rare, behind-the-scenes conversation between a <b>pilot</b> and <b>ATC</b> as they 
    explore:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What contrails are and how they form
    </li>
    <li>
      Why they matter more than most people realise
    </li>
    <li>
      What aviation could do right now to reduce contrails
    </li>
    <li>
      How simple operational shifts could deliver fast climate benefits – and what’s 
      standing in the way
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is an honest, practical conversation between two people who see the skies from 
    different angles – and believe real progress is possible when we work together.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you love flying and care about the planet, this is a conversation not to miss.
