            <h5>Do you want to stop everybody flying completely?</h5>
          </summary>
          <p>
            No! We expect flying will always continue in some form. What we are challenging is excessive or
            unsustainable growth. We want our industry to be realistic about the levels of air traffic possible in the
            near future, and we believe the sooner we plan for and implement a transition to low-emissions transport,
            the more flying will be possible in the future.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            Flying provides &lsquo;liberty and freedom&rsquo;, so won&rsquo;t regulations take this away?
          </summary>
          <p>
            There are responsibilities and costs that accompany liberties and freedoms. Currently, the true cost of
            flying is not reflected in the price. We need to recognise the real cost of flying in terms of its
            environmental impact and use of resources. That doesn&rsquo;t mean zero flying, but recognising that flying
            can be done in a more distributed and sparing manner than it is today.
          </p>
          <p>
            There&rsquo;s a limit to the amount of carbon we can emit before exceeding our global carbon budget for
            1.5⁰C of global warming. If we do so, we&rsquo;ll risk uncontrollable and irreversible climate, ecological
            and societal collapse. Limiting global air traffic is therefore a small price to pay for long-term
            preservation of our society and natural world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often the tourist destinations which are most popular to visit are also at most risk of collapse: orangutan
            habitats within rainforests, marine habitats and coral reefs, and low-lying island beaches. By continuing to
            increase our emissions, we&rsquo;ll contribute to the destruction of these regions &ndash; and will limit
            our ability, and that of future generations, to continue to visit and enjoy them. Likewise, whether we can
            continue to support a thriving aviation sector into the future is dependent on our ability to limit
            emissions over the next decade.

          <summary>If we need to fly less, should I be ashamed of my industry or career choice?</summary>
          <p>
            Not at all. We&rsquo;re sure that most people choose a career in aviation with good intentions &ndash; a
            desire to connect people and enable the world to travel. These are positive aspirations. However, we do want
            to&nbsp;<em>remain</em>&nbsp;proud of our industry, and can surely only do so if we&rsquo;re honest about
            the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231020305689">impacts of flying</a
            >, and the changes required to reduce these impacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Individual actions are important and powerful.&nbsp;<a

            to push for change. Ultimately, we need a range of strategies, and must support &amp; collaborate with each
            other &ndash; solidarity is key. Real power is derived from&nbsp;<a

        <details>
          <summary>If I fly as a consumer, should I be ashamed of my actions?</summary>
          <p>
            No, as we don&rsquo;t accept the narrative that diverts attention from corporate leaders and places
            responsibility for the climate crisis on the shoulders of individuals instead. It is a manipulative strategy
            that can undermine efforts to decarbonise by allowing large corporations to avoid responsibility and
            scrutiny.&nbsp;<a
              href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/23/big-oil-coined-carbon-footprints-to-blame-us-for-their-greed-keep-them-on-the-hook"
              >Pointing the finger at consumers</a
            >&nbsp;can toxify the debate around climate action &ndash; when we need to foster cooperation and
            collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we support individual actions (for instance&nbsp;<a href="https://flightfree.co.uk/">flying less</a
            >&nbsp;as consumers), we believe that the impact of aviation must be addressed through regulation and
            industry-wide action, not by shaming individuals who have less power to address systemic issues. Shame
            isn&rsquo;t an effective approach, but positive collective actions can help us move forwards together.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            We&rsquo;ve noticed a misunderstanding around the &lsquo;<em>Flygskam</em>&rsquo; concept that originated in
            Sweden. This translates to &lsquo;<em>Flight-Shame</em>&rsquo; and personal shame felt when you realise your
            actions have negative consequences, but importantly does not mean &lsquo;<em>Flight-Shaming</em>&rsquo; of
            others who fly. Apart from anything else, there is a lot of misinformation related to the climate-impact of
            aviation and many air travellers do not fully understand this yet, or have been misled through greenwash
            about the ability of technology or e.g. carbon offsetting to minimise this impact. As far as we&rsquo;re
            aware, no environmental group is intentionally &lsquo;flight-shaming&rsquo; others.

            The aviation industry is currently on its knees due to COVID-19, why do you think this is an appropriate
            time to talk about limiting air traffic growth?
          </summary>
          <p>
            We empathise with any worker currently experiencing a loss or reduction in employment due to the pandemic
            &ndash; this is an incredibly difficult time and even if you have stayed in full-time employment, the
            uncertainty in the aviation industry created by the pandemic is likely to have impacted your mental health.
            This is exactly the situation we want to avoid, but are worried will happen again in the future if another,
            potentially far bigger, industry crash is induced by the climate crisis &ndash; given how out-of-touch
            current aviation policies are from what&rsquo;s necessary to limit global warming to 1.5&deg;C.
          </p>
          <p>
            We fully-support a return to the sector for any aviation workers currently out of work due to the pandemic.
            What we take issue with, is future unrestricted expansion of global air traffic (and associated hiring of
            new employees), if that growth is fundamentally unsustainable.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The truth is that aviation workers are already facing multiple inter-related crises:
            health&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;climate. Furthermore, we&rsquo;ve noted the recent re-emergence of the
            &lsquo;pilot shortage&rsquo; narrative being perpetuated by industry which only serves to water down Terms
            &amp; Conditions and saturate an already challenging job market.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to&nbsp;<em>strike while the iron is hot</em>&nbsp;and prepare for inevitable changes to the
            industry. The fact that some airline, airport, factory etc. expansion plans have currently been paused,
            actually places us in a useful position where we can take-stock, assess the situation, and pivot our
            industry towards a safe and sustainable trajectory.

            Flying is only 3% of global CO2 emissions &ndash; isn&rsquo;t it only a small part of the problem?
          </summary>
          <p>
            3% of global CO2&nbsp;emissions is a very large amount. If aviation were a country, it would rank

            >&nbsp;and this doesn&rsquo;t even account for non-CO2&nbsp;emissions which approximately&nbsp;<a

            >&nbsp;beyond CO2&nbsp;emissions alone. Aviation&rsquo;s growth trajectory is also important, as its share

          <p>
            The socio-economic distribution of flying is also important as these emissions are produced by a

          <summary>Other sectors produce more emissions, why not focus on those instead?</summary>
          <p>
            Emissions from all sectors contribute to reducing our remaining carbon budget, so it is indeed crucial to
            reach sustainable levels in each and every one. As aviation workers, we want our industry to take ownership
            of its impact and plans to credibly reduce this. Aviation is a very long-term industry which heavily relies
            on high density energy sources and is difficult to electrify. This makes it very difficult to decarbonise
            and means that it is very energy- and emissions intensive. For example: someone flying from Lisbon to New
            York and back generates roughly the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en"
              >same level of emissions as the average person in the EU does by heating their home for a whole year</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            While other sectors have decreased their emissions, historical trends show how aviation emissions have grown
            at a x3 higher rate than overall global emissions (e.g.<a
              href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311746640_Emission_Reduction_Targets_for_International_Aviation_and_Shipping"
              >&nbsp;between 1990 and 2010, aviation CO2 has increased by 70% compared to the 25% increase in global CO2
              emissions</a
            >). Future growth forecasts are in line with these trends and would position aviation as one of the top
            emitting sectors in 2050. We can&rsquo;t afford to wait and let this happen &ndash; so we need to take
            action now, to change this trajectory.

            towards a brick wall, it&rsquo;s never too late to hit the brakes and minimise the impact. We need to
            mitigate the severity of global warming, and will only have a chance of doing so if we reduce the most
            emissions-intensive activities (such as flying), as soon as possible. As workers, we need to plan for this
            change by preparing ourselves and attempting to steer the industry away from danger.
