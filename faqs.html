                  No! We expect flying will always continue in some form. What we are challenging is excessive or
                  unsustainable growth. We want our industry to be realistic about the levels of air traffic possible in
                  the near future, and we believe the sooner we plan for and implement a transition to low-emissions
                  transport, the more flying will be possible in the future.

                  <p>
                    There are responsibilities and costs that accompany liberties and freedoms. Currently, the true cost
                    of flying is not reflected in the price. We need to recognise the real cost of flying in terms of
                    its environmental impact and use of resources. That doesn&rsquo;t mean zero flying, but recognising
                    that flying can be done in a more distributed and sparing manner than it is today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There&rsquo;s a limit to the amount of carbon we can emit before exceeding our global carbon budget
                    for 1.5⁰C of global warming. If we do so, we&rsquo;ll risk uncontrollable and irreversible climate,
                    ecological and societal collapse. Limiting global air traffic is therefore a small price to pay for
                    long-term preservation of our society and natural world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Often the tourist destinations which are most popular to visit are also at most risk of collapse:
                    orangutan habitats within rainforests, marine habitats and coral reefs, and low-lying island
                    beaches. By continuing to increase our emissions, we&rsquo;ll contribute to the destruction of these
                    regions &ndash; and will limit our ability, and that of future generations, to continue to visit and
                    enjoy them. Likewise, whether we can continue to support a thriving aviation sector into the future
                    is dependent on our ability to limit emissions over the next decade.

                  a desire to connect people and enable the world to travel. These are positive aspirations. However, we

                    Emissions from all sectors contribute to reducing our remaining carbon budget, so it is indeed
                    crucial to reach sustainable levels in each and every one. As aviation workers, we want our industry
                    to take ownership of its impact and plans to credibly reduce this. Aviation is a very long-term
                    industry which heavily relies on high density energy sources and is difficult to electrify. This
                    makes it very difficult to decarbonise and means that it is very energy- and emissions intensive.
                    For example: someone flying from Lisbon to New York and back generates roughly the&nbsp;<a
                      href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en"
                      >same level of emissions as the average person in the EU does by heating their home for a whole

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While other sectors have decreased their emissions, historical trends show how aviation emissions
                    have grown at a x3 higher rate than overall global emissions (e.g.<a
                      href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311746640_Emission_Reduction_Targets_for_International_Aviation_and_Shipping"
                      >&nbsp;between 1990 and 2010, aviation CO2 has increased by 70% compared to the 25% increase in
                      global CO2 emissions</a
                    >). Future growth forecasts are in line with these trends and would position aviation as one of the
                    top emitting sectors in 2050. We can&rsquo;t afford to wait and let this happen &ndash; so we need
                    to take action now, to change this trajectory.
