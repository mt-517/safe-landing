  <p class="mb-6">We are a group of aviation workers campaigning for long-term employment. 
    We do this by challenging industry leaders to conform with climate science and reject 
    dangerous growth. As pilots, cabin crew, airport staff, aerospace engineers, factory 
    workers and more, we love the aviation industry and the positive impact it brings to 
    society. Join us now to protect the future of flying, and the planet we love. </p>
  
  <p class="mb-6">Safe Landing is divided into two groups: <b>The Core Team</b>, who work 
    full-time and part-time for us – and the <b>Safe Landing Community</b>: Made up of 
    aviation workers, and non-aviation workers too, the community is full of people who 
    love aviation and care about the future of the planet – everyone is welcome on our 
    journey towards a Safe Landing.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400">After a long flying career as a flight instructor, an Airbus A340 pilot, and then a NetJets Management Pilot, I started looking into the impact that aviation was having on the planet. It was not something that was being discussed around me in any depth. The ultimate result was that I quit my job, stopped working as a pilot and went back to college, among other climate credentials, I now hold a Masters in Sustainable Aviation.</p>

Safe Landing offers me a space to be truthful about my own conflicted and compromised feelings. The deep knowledge and understanding of the members has greatly enhanced my own understanding of both the technical and political challenges. Being part of this inspiring group gives me the hope and motivation to keep working towards mitigating the climate impacts of aviation.</p>
